# Finding A Great ML Job

Welcome to my GitHub repository! After completing my Master's degree and spending several months developing my skills through Kaggle challenges, I've started journey of finding a fulfilling role in the field of Machine Learning.

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my:
	
    Academic Documents: This contains transcripts, certificates and grade distributions from my academic journey.
    Certificates and Tests: Other credentials that highlight my expertise and accomplishments.
    Code and Projects: Demonstrations of my coding skills and project implementations. Also contains my Master's Thesis.
    Scientific Writing: Samples that show my ability to articulate complex technical concepts.

In addition to the above, I've initiated a unique side project: a timeline of my job search process. This timeline not only keeps me accountable but also aims to provide insights, experiences, and perhaps some inspiration for others on a similar journey.

Feel free to explore, and feedback is always welcome!
