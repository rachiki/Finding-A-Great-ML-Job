# Finding-A-Great-ML-Job
After finishing my master I did a few months of Kaggle challenges and now want to find a cool ML job. Here I document this process daily. 
The goal is to keep myself accountable and to help other people in their journey. Also I can link to this repository, maybe there's some cool stuff in here later that recruiters like.

July 3rd, Monday: Today I looked around for a few companies and positions, I currently focus on finding a high paying job in an ML role at a company with positive or at least neutral impact on the world. 
What I noticed is that there seem to be much less junior positions than senior positions. I already have my linkedin profile set to "looking for a job" but the roles recruiters wrote me about didn't excite me so far. I also put up a profile on Hired and will update later on how well that worked.

July 4th, Tuesday: I started the day by transferring my resume, certifcates and good examples of my coding skills to linux, I just recently switched from Windows.
Sidestory - Why I switched from Windows to Linux: When I started competing in Deep Learning Kaggle competitions I noticed that I need to either rent a server or buy     a good GPU to compete. I got the GPU, but when I set it up on Windows it was much slower than it should be, one reason being that I didn't get multiprocessing in      dataloading running well. Linux had it's own problems, but in the end it was almost twice as fast.
I also think about which Certificates to include in the CV and how good of a signal workera or other skill testing platforms offer to recruiters, with googling + GPT4 it would be incredibly easy to fake high proficiency there.
I decided on uploading all my master thesis material, as I'm happy with how it turned out. It is pretty well organized, researched and has some novel insights. I also gonna record my Master presentation and upload it here, I think that might be a good way to show presentation skills, what my thesis was about and to show spoken English proficiency. 
I found tons of projects I did that I want to do small writeups off. I build a mining PC in 2019 for Monero, participated in a student consultancy, where I build a chatbot for a large German company, participated in the Rohde & Schwarz competition for identifying empty pill blisters in CT scans. I also have some small code snippets I want to upload, like a scraper for E-Books.
I registered in Alumni Networks for TU Ilmenau and TU München, the Universities I did my Bachelor and Master at. The TU München one is especially interesting because it offers a job forum. 
I found some cool jobs in biotech at the TUM job board, I have a lot of experience in this area already and want to deepen that by doing two more Kaggle competitions: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hubmap-hacking-the-human-vasculature/discussion/418009 and https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cafa-5-protein-function-prediction/code. For the second competition one guy that asked me if we can cooperate on it asked me for resources on protein embeddings. I looked a bit and send it over. I was also at an AI alignment talk of Marvin van Hagen and had an idea for a new NLP architecture that I will need to make a write-up on at some time. 

July 5th, Wednesday: I looked through other old projects but did not find any more that I want to add. I started rewriting my master presentation for a broader audience but only got halfway through, before switching to non-job related work (taxes).

July 6th, Thursday: Finished rewriting the presentation. I read this article http://mindingourway.com/obvious-advice/ and used the advice. I wrote down a list of people I'll schedule meetings with over the next week to get their advice. I had a long talk with a friend who recently read a book about career advice: 'So Good They Can't Ignore You', the main part I took away from that topic is that I should focus a lot on building career capital, so skill building in the early parts of my career. He also mentioned that it's a useful exercise to look for people in the job, ask them for feedback and also look for the typical daily schedule of the jobs. We also talked about the moral basis of different jobs as I want to have a positive impact and talked about 80.000 hours. I remembered that they offer personalized career advice. I read 1/4 of the book 'So Good They Can't Ignore You' my friend recommended.

July 7th, Friday: Paused today with job search, worked on Kaggle (HubMAP - Hacking the Human Vasculature).

July 8th, Saturday: Worked on CV/resume, I've read that it's two different things, the CV being a comprehensive list of stations in your career path, education, skills and achievements and a resume being more tailor made to the job/company you apply to and shorter. The CV is pretty common in Germany where I currently live, so I do that one first and then cut it down depending on the job I apply to.
I noticed that apparently you need stuff like SQL/pandas a lot for interacting with data, companies have so I spend a bit over 2 hours doing a basic SQL tutorial https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/introduction that I think was pretty good. Read another 1/4 of the book.

July 9th, Sunday: Relaxed today.

July 10th, Monday: Finished CV, uploaded on Hired. Organized certifications and worked on making the Advent of Code 2021 code run easily and picked a few pieces that showcase programming skill well.

July 11th, Tuesday: Finished advent of code cleanup, selected the rest I want to polish. Cleaned up neural style transfer. I will also need to polish my VESUV challenge code. Another TO-DO: New professional images, my current ones are a bit unprofessional. Need to make a short resume, include links (should I mention building mining PC? VESUV? Mention 7/60 RS challenge)

July 12th, Wednesday: Finished the last 1/2 of the book 'So Good They Can't Ignore You'. I also recommend it. 
A short summary would be that the popular passion mindset, where people think there's the one true dream job/calling for them and they just need to find it, is wrong. Almost noone knows what they really want to do from the start and even if they did, chances are lots of people have the same passion and it's hard to compete. The author Cal Newport suggests following the craftsman mindset instead. Here you focus on creating things of value for others. You can first start somewhere and it does not matter too much if that position is already a super good fit. While working you get better, buildilng career capital, especially by employing deliberate practice (going out of your comfort zone and confronting difficult tasks). This career capital can be used to acquire nice career features like more control over what you do or following a mission (notice that he does not necessarily mean by negotiating with a current employer, you could also go freelance if you're competent enough and you have a good reputation). 

July 13th, Thursday: Work on resume continues. Tips I saw are: 
One page only, 
skip objective, 
short bullets, 
accomplishment oriented (also quantify!), 
top projects list 3-5 (can be academic), 
additional experience etc should be relevant,
single vs multi column is hard to decide,
skills after education (?),
