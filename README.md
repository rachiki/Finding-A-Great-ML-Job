# Finding-A-Great-ML-Job
After finishing my master I did a few months of Kaggle challenges and now want to find a cool ML job. Here I document this process daily. 
The goal is to keep myself accountable and to help other people in their journey. Also I can link to this repository, maybe there's some cool stuff in here later that recruiters like.

July 3rd: Today I looked around for a few companies and positions, I currently focus on finding a high paying job in an ML role at a company with positive or at least neutral impact on the world. 
What I noticed is that there seem to be much less junior positions than senior positions. I already have my linkedin profile set to "looking for a job" but the roles recruiters wrote me about didn't excite me so far. I also put up a profile on Hired and will inform you later on how well that worked.

July 4th: I started the day by transferring my resume, certifcates and good examples of my coding skills to linux, I just recently switched from Windows.
Sidestory - Why I switched from Windows to Linux: When I started competing in Deep Learning Kaggle competitions I noticed that I need to either rent a server or buy     a good GPU to compete. I got the GPU, but when I set it up on Windows it was much slower than it should be, one reason being that I didn't get multiprocessing in      dataloading running well. Linux had it's own problems, but in the end it was almost twice as fast.
I also think about which Certificates to include in the CV and how good of a signal workera or other skill testing platforms offer to recruiters, with googling + GPT4 it would be incredibly easy to fake high proficiency there.
I decided on uploading all my master thesis material, as I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. It is pretty well organized, researched and has some novel insights. I also gonna record my Master presentation and upload it here, I think that might be a good way to show presentation skills, what my thesis was about and to show spoken English proficiency. 
I found tons of projects I did that I want to do small writeups off. I build a mining PC in 2019 for Monero, participated in a student consultancy, where I build a chatbot for a large German company, participated in the Rohde & Schwarz competition for identifying empty pill blisters in CT scans. I also have some small code snippets I want to upload, like a scraper for E-Books.
I registered in Alumni Networks for TU Ilmenau and TU München, the Universities I did my Bachelor and Master at. The TU München one is especially interesting because it offers a job forum.
