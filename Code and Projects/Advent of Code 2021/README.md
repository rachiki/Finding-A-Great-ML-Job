# Advent of Code Overview

Advent of Code (AOC) is a renowned annual online programming contest that unfolds from December 1st to December 25th. Much like an advent calendar, it releases a fresh puzzle daily. Its popularity is evident from the 250,000 participants in 2021 alone.

Each problem consists of two parts, when you solve the first, you unlock the second. Each provides 1 star, with people solving all problems getting 50 stars.

The contest is designed with an escalating degree of difficulty. Initial puzzles are straightforward, but as December advances, the challenges demand hours of intricate problem-solving even for seasoned coders. Participants navigate through tasks demanding algorithmic thinking, data manipulation, analytical skills, mathematical insights, and occasionally, specialized knowledge.

To underscore the contest's rigor, of the 250,000 entrants in 2021, fewer than 12,000 reached the finish line, a feat I'm proud of achieving.

1. This folder contains a subfolder with all my solutions and inputs.
2. A collection showcases exemplary solutions, many from forums where people share their code. While I've contributed two solutions to this collection, the majority come from other talented programmers.
3. I took problem 19, which was one of the hardest in 2021, and polished it with explanations and small visualizations of the input and my solution approach.
