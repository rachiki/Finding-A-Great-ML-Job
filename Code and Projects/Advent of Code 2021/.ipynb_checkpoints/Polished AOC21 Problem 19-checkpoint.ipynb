    "\n",
    "This puzzle is about reconstructing the position of scanners and beacons in a 3D environment. \n",
    "The crux is that only the position of scanners relative to the beacons is given, not in absolute terms.\n",
    "The beacons are homogenous too, so you do not know which beacons are observed from each scanner.\n",
    "You have to deduce the absolute positions in space, build a map and count the beacons in question 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that we:\n",
    "1. identify overlapping beacon detections between pairs of scanners.\n",
    "2. determine the relative position and orientation of one scanner to another based on overlaps.\n",
    "3. reconstruct the entire map based on the relative positions and orientations.\n",
    "4. count the number of unique beacons."

    "## Solution approach\n",
    "We initiate a queue of scanners from scanner 0 and try to find another scanner-rotation combination that has high overlap in beacon positions.\n",
    "If we have the relative positions of the beacons for the current scanner and the relative position of a new scanner-rotation combination, \n",
    "we can calculate all possible new scanner positions by beacon_x(scanner_old) - beacon_y(scanner_new). \n",
    "If a scanner position pops up in a high number of the possible positions it is likely that we have the correct position and rotation of the new scanner.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given our input example we would calculate:\n",
    "    positions = beacons_scanner0 - beacons_scanner1\n",
    "    positions = [[1,3],[5,2],[2,1],\n",
    "                [5,2],[9,1],[6,0],\n",
    "                [4,4],[8,3],[5,2]]\n",
    "You can see that the correct potential distance (5,2) pops up often here, in the real input we have always around 25 beacons detected per scanner and a guarantee from the original problem description that 12 overlaps is enough to determine the correct position. We just have to add all possible rotations, do this with all scanners and iterate until the scanners are accounted for.\n",
